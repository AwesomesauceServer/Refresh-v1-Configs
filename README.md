## Refresh-v1 Configuration Files
#### Configuration files for the Refresh-v1 modpack hosted on the Awesomesauce Server community server.

The modpack is a private modpack for a semi-private community. The config files are for both the server and clients.

Any and **all** config changes need to be requested through making a issue request. All commits must have an accurate name for the commit, not just "Fixed something" etc..
